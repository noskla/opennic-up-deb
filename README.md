**OpenNIC auto DNS updater**

## Installation
### Manual installation
The `opennic-up` Bash script can be downloaded to your preferred location.
The systemd service and timer provided are to be copied to `/usr/lib/systemd/system/`.

### Arch Linux package
If you use [Arch Linux][1], a package is available [here][2] and provides a full integration of the automated update process.

### Gentoo package
If you use [Gentoo][5], a package is available [here][6] and provides full integration for the automated update process.

### Scheduled update with systemd time
A systemd timer unit is provided, to enable and start the timer that will update the DNS servers twice a week, use:
```
# systemctl enable --now opennic-up.timer
```
### Dependencies
The tools *awk*, *sort*, *uniq*, *curl*, *fping*, *xargs* and *drill* are required and must be found in the environment path.
Network Manager is an optional dependency and will be used if installed.

#### Arch Linux
For Arch Linux users this corresponds to two dependencies on top of the base distribution which will be installed if not already present: `fping` and `ldns`.

#### RedHat, CentOS, Fedora
You will need to install `fping` and `ldns`. On Fedora, you will need to install `ldns-utils`.

#### Ubuntu
For Ubuntu users, *drill* is provided by the `ldnsutils` package.

#### Gentoo, Funtoo
You will need to install `net-analyzer/fping`, `net-dns/ldns-utils`, and `net-misc/curl`.

## Syntax

`# opennic-up [options]`
```
options:
    -q  quiet
    -v  version
    -h  help
    -f  <file> custom resolv.conf file
```

By default, it replaces the DNS servers with the 3 most responsive [OpenNIC][0] DNS servers for your location.

* If Network Manager *nmcli* is found in the path, it is used to update the DNS entries
* Otherwise the `/etc/resolv.conf` file is updated directly with the new nameservers, keeping the other options untouched
* When `-f` is used, Network Manager is ignored and the custom `resolv.conf` will receive the update

## Configuration

`opennic-up.conf` is the configuration file for *opennic-up*.

*opennic-up* looks for the file at the location `/etc/opennic-up.conf`. Alternatively it can be saved in the user location `~/.config/opennic-up/opennic-up.conf` and in this case it takes precedence over the former.

* The configuration file defines the OpenNIC [member][3]'s **user** and **auth** used to register one's IP for [whitelisting][4]. For example:
```
user=myusername
auth=TbuARbBxHHGznNScvVLKZDDR9ZGVKdhqxj8dkzCQ
```
* The number of DNS servers to retain, 3 by default, can be changed using the **maxretain** option:
```
maxretain=2
```
* The minimum required reliability of DNS servers as indicated in the retrieved server list, 90 by default (for 90% reliability), can be changed using the **minreliability** option:
```
minreliability=2
```
* The DNS server used for the initial api.opennicproject.org's name resolution, more than one can be provided for fallback (space separated):
```
initdns=1.1.1.1 208.67.222.123
```
